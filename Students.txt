Finn Farrell and Kate ORielly
We understand that this project is not very good, but a lot of time has been engaged and if we could scrape a pass that would really go a long way.
We have tried to fix as many issues as time has permitted and we hope the effort made is reflected in enough of a grade to be able to take the final exam !
